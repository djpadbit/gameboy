# FXGB
## This is not a real emulator but more of a POC
FXGB is a port of a gameboy emulator (look at the source of the fork for original emulator) for the casio FX range of calculators.
The program is currently running at ~2fps (~8fps overclocked) so it's not really useable.
I made it mostly for fun so don't really think it's gonna be maintained much.

Fun fact: this is my first add-in with gint.

# Current features:
* It does run games (at blazingly fast 2fps)
* I guess it's pretty cool ?
* Ehhhh

# How to use:
Put a 32kb gameboy rom on the root of the calculator and name it "tet.gb" (Only tested with tetris).

Launch the add-in, then just press any key until you reach a screen with 4 numbers on the side.
If you are interested, the first number is the current frame number, the second is the fps and the 2 more are the controls representations.

The controles are 

A is SHIFT

B is ALPHA

Select is OPTN

Start is VARS

Then use the directionnal arrows
