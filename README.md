# FXGB
## This is not a real emulator but more of a POC
FXGB is a gameboy emulator for the casio FX range of calculators.
The program is currently running at ~2fps (~8fps overclocked) so it's not really useable.
I made it mostly for fun so don't really think it's gonna be maintained much.
The program looks for a 32kb rom (Only tested on tetris) called "tet.gb" in the root of the calculator.
Fun fact: this is my first add-in with gint.

# Current features:
* It does run games (at blazingly fast 2fps)
* Ehhhh
